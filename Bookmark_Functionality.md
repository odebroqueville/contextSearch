# Bookmark Functionality Enhancement

## Overview
This enhancement adds bookmark icons to both the Bookmarks and History pages in Context Search. Users can now easily add/remove items from their Context Search bookmarks using clickable icons.

## Features

### Bookmark Icons
- **Red bookmark icon** : Indicates the item is NOT bookmarked in Context Search
- **Grey bookmark icon** : Indicates the item IS bookmarked in Context Search

### Functionality
1. **Add to Bookmarks**: Click the red bookmark icon to add an item to the "Bookmarks" folder in Context Search
2. **Remove from Bookmarks**: Click the grey bookmark icon to remove an item from the "Bookmarks" folder in Context Search
3. **Auto-creation**: The "Bookmarks" folder is automatically created if it doesn't exist
4. **Real-time Updates**: Icons update immediately when clicked to reflect the current bookmark status

### Technical Implementation

#### Files Modified
1. **scripts/utilities.js** (NEW - renamed from bookmark-utils.js): Central shared utility module for bookmark management and generic helpers
2. **scripts/bookmarks.js**: Enhanced to include bookmark icons for each bookmark item
3. **scripts/history.js**: Enhanced to include bookmark icons for each history item  
4. **styles/bookmarks.css**: Added styles for bookmark icons
5. **styles/history.css**: Added styles for bookmark icons
6. **cs_service_worker.js**: Added real-time notification system for options page updates
7. **scripts/options.js**: Added message handling for automatic display updates

#### Key Functions
- `isItemBookmarked()`: Checks if an item is already bookmarked
- `addItemToBookmarks()`: Adds an item to the Bookmarks folder
- `removeItemFromBookmarks()`: Removes an item from the Bookmarks folder
- `createBookmarkIcon()`: Creates the clickable bookmark icon element
- `notifyOptionsPages()`: Notifies open options pages when bookmarks are updated

#### How it Works
1. The bookmark status is determined by checking if the item's URL exists in the "Bookmarks" folder within the search engines list
2. Each bookmark/history item gets a bookmark icon positioned in the top-right corner
3. Clicking the icon toggles the bookmark status and updates the search engines storage
4. The icon appearance changes immediately to reflect the new status
5. **Automatic Updates**: When bookmarks are modified, the service worker automatically notifies any open options pages to refresh their display

### User Experience
- Icons are positioned in the top-right corner of each item for easy access
- Hover effects provide visual feedback
- Tooltips explain the action (Add/Remove from Context Search bookmarks)
- No page refresh needed - changes are applied immediately
- **Real-time Options Page Updates**: If the Options page is open, it automatically refreshes to show bookmark changes

### Benefits
- Quick and intuitive way to manage Context Search bookmarks
- Consistent interface across both Bookmarks and History pages
- Reduces the need to navigate to the Options page for bookmark management
- Visual feedback makes bookmark status immediately clear
- **Seamless Integration**: Options page automatically stays in sync with bookmark changes
