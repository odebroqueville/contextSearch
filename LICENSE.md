## End-User License Agreement (EULA) of Context Search
This End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between
you and Olivier de Broqueville.

This EULA agreement governs your acquisition and use of our Context
Search software ("Software") directly from Olivier de
Broqueville or indirectly through an authorised reseller
or distributor (a "Reseller").

Please read this EULA agreement carefully before completing the
installation process and using the Context Search software.
It provides a license to use the Context Search software
and contains warranty information and liability disclaimers.

If you register for a free trial of the Context Search software, this EULA agreement will also govern that trial. By clicking "accept" or installing and/or using the Context Search software, you are confirming your acceptance of the Software and agreeing to become bound by the terms of this EULA agreement.

If you are entering into this EULA agreement on behalf of a company or
other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind
such entity and its affiliates to these terms and conditions. If you do
not have such authority or if you do not agree with the terms and
conditions of this EULA agreement, do not install or use the Software,
and you must not accept this EULA agreement.

This EULA agreement shall apply only to the Software supplied by
Olivier de Broqueville herewith regardless of whether
other software is referred to or described herein. The terms also apply
to any Context Search updates, supplements, Internet-based
services, and support services for the Software, unless other terms
accompany those items on delivery. If so, those terms apply.
